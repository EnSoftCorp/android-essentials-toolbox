      The Android Essentials Toolbox is a collection program analysis tools specifically developed for analyzing Android applications. The toolbox aids in mapping Android Permission Groups and Protection Levels to Permissions as well as Permissions to the respective permission protected Android APIs. These relationships are encoded in the tool and seamlessly applied to a program graph by leveraging the Atlas framework.
